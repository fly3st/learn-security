An IP address is used to identify a host on a network for a period of time.

The IP address is divided into 4 octets:

| Octet #1 | Octet #2 | Octet #3 | Octet #4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0-255    | 0-255    | 0-255    | 0-255    |
There's two types of IP addresses:

* Public IP Address
* Private IP Address

| IP Address   | IP Address Type |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 192.168.1.77 | Private         |
| 86.157.52.21 | Public          |
| 192.168.1.74 | Private         |
| 86.157.52.21 | Public          |

Private IP Addresses are used on a private network to communicate with each other, but when data is sent to the internet from any of these private addresses they will all use the same public address given to them by their Internet Service Provider (ISP).

These IP Addresses are an older version known as IPv4, which is still used to this day but has the limit of using the numbering system of 2^32 (4.29 billion), this is why there's the newer version of IPv6.

IPv6 supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion +) and is more efficient due to new methodologies.

An IPv6 address looks like the following example: `2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d`
