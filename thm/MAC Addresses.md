A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique address that is given to a device by the factory it was built at.
The address itself is a 12 character hexadecimal number (base16) split into two's and separated by a colon (:).
An example of a MAC address would look like this - `a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`.
The first 6 characters represent the company that made the network interface and the last 6 characters are unique.

These addresses can be faked (or "spoofed"), which could be used against some firewalls.
