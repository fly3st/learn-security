# learn-security

This repo hosts all of my notes that I write for my security-related studies.
This includes:

* Writeups
* General notes on fundementals (OSs, networking, security, etc.)
* Scripts and automations

I host this for my own personal convenience and it can be used to help solidify your own knowledge / notes.
**Feel free to correct me on any of these, I'm always learning.**
